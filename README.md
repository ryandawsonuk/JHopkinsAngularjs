#Coursera Angular JS

This is for the completed assignments for the Coursera Course 'Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS'

##Course Content
* Week 1 is an overview and covers how to set up an Angular app with a controller and some expressions.
* Week 2 is on services, factories, providers and conditional logic.
* Week 3 is on directives and promises.
* Week 4 is on components, modules and routing.
* Week 5 is on validation and testing (unit testing via Jasmine is unassessed optional material).

##Course projects
Each week has a peer-reviewed exercise to demonstrate the concepts covered. The folders in this repository contain submissions for those assignments, together with the assignment instructios (in the README.md files).

The final course project adds Angular to a website that wasn't using a JS framework (just ajax and bootstrap) and angularises all of the direct DOM manipulation code. This is the result - https://ryandawsonuk.github.io/JHopkinsAngularjs/module5/#/
